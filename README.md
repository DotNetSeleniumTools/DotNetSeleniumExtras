# DotNetSeleniumExtras
Extra utilities for use with the Selenium .NET language bindings.

This repository is a migration of code from the [Selenium project's](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium)
.NET bindings. It consists of the `PageFactory` implementation and the `ExpectedConditions` classes from the
Selenium.Support library.

## THIS REPOSITORY WILL NOT ACCEPT ISSUES OR PULL REQUESTS UNTIL A NEW OWNER IS FOUND

The code has been extracted here to preserve it for users, to provide a place for users to continue to use
the existing implementations when the impelementations are removed from the Selenium project. It is hoped
that this repo will serve as a starting point for a community-based implementation of the projects herein,
at which point, this repo will no longer be necessary.
